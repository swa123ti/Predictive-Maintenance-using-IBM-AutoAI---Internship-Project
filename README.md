# Predictive Maintenance using IBM AutoAI

This project predicts machine failures (Tool Wear, Overstrain, Heat Dissipation Failure, etc.) using IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Predictive Maintenance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification)

## Steps Followed
1. Uploaded dataset in IBM Cloud Watson Studio
2. Used AutoAI to create classification models
3. Selected best performing pipeline (accuracy, F1-score)
4. Deployed model (optional)
5. Exported model and report files

## Files
- `/data` – raw dataset
- `/screenshots` – IBM AutoAI experiment screenshots
- `/model` – exported model pipeline & JSON
